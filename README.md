# Welcome to Weekly Algorithms-Study!

We solve coding problems with a focus on a particular topic each week. 

## Commit Conventions

```
- feat: <name> #<problem number>
- refactor: <name> #<problem number> <reason for refactoring the code, i.e., for better time complexity>
- fix: <name> #<problem number>
```

## Branching Strategy

- main: includes all problems solved in this group. Each branch is merged to this branch after the weekly meet-up session.
- weekXX-topic: Branches for each week’s topic (e.g., week01-stack-queue, week02-dynamic-programming).

## Issues and Discussions
- Issues: Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, ask questions, etc.. Label issues appropriately (e.g., week01, bug).
- Discussions: Participate in discussions for general questions or team communication.
